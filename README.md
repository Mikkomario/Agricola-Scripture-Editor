# Agricola
Agricola is a scripture editor for iPad devices.

Agricola is designed to be used as a more approachable tool for Bible translation in comparison to existing tools like Paratext. 
Agricola can be used alongside Paratext and other editors which support the USX format.

The project is currently in it's pre-alpha phase and data breaking changes are common.

Currently [8.5.2017] online synchronization is not part of the editor due to lack of back end resources. Peer to peer synchronization is available, however.
