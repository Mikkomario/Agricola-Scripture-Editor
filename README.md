# TranslationEditor
Translation editor (or TEOS) is a Bible translation editor for iPad devices.

TEOS is designed to be used as a more approachable tool for Bible translation in comparison to existing tools like Paratext. 
TEOS can be used alongside Paratext and other editors which support the USX format.

The project is currently in it's very early pre-alpha phase and cannot be used for effective Bible translation just yet.
